    bio: [
      "Hello, my name is Evan Bylewski,",
      "I started gymnastics when I was 3 years old and began competing USAG at the age of 8. In high school, I competed for the boys gymnastics team at Amherst High with a three-year undefeated record. In 2004 I received the Mark Monaco Memorial Gymnast of the Year award, recognizing the most outstanding male gymnast in NYS. By the time I completed high school, I was a USAG Level 10.",
      "I attended the University at Buffalo, where I competed for their men's gymnastics team. I competed nationally 3 out of 4 years and ranked 28th in the nation for NAIGC men's college gymnastics in 2008. After retiring in 2012, I earned my BA in mathematics.",
      "This will be my 21st year as a coach. I began coaching at 16 at Buffalo Turners and have since held positions such as Head Men's Coach at Flips Gymnastics, Head Coach of the UB Women's Gymnastics Team, and Girls Varsity Coach at Sweet Home High School. From 2012 to 2020, I coached private lessons and tumbling classes at Elite Heat All-Stars. In 2013, I started Tumbling of WNY, Inc., and I'm very excited for the next chapter in life. The rest of my story has yet to be written."
